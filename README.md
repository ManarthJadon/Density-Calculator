# Density calculator (Mass in Air & Water)

A web tool to determine an object’s density using its mass in air and in water, applying a simple logic of division with an experimental design implementation.

## 🚀 About

This calculator allows you to find the density of an object by directly dividing its mass in air by its mass in water. The result is presented in g/cm³, reflecting a basic experimental approach.

## ⚗️ How It Works

- **Inputs:**  
  - Mass in air (g)  
  - Mass in water (g)

- **Formula Used:**  
  \[
  \text{Density} = \frac{\text{Mass in air}}{\text{Mass in water}}
  \]
  *(Units: g/cm³)*

## 🛠️ Usage

1. Enter mass in air and in water.
2. Click **Calculate Density**.
3. View the result below.
