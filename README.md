# Specific Gravity Calculator (Mass in Air & Water)

A web tool to determine an object’s density using its mass in air and in water, applying a simple logic of division with an experimental design implementation.

## 🚀 About

This calculator uses the Archimedes principle:  
By measuring mass in air and mass in water, it calculates density with a straightforward division, reflecting a classic experimental approach.

## ⚗️ How It Works

- **Inputs:**  
  - Mass in air (g or kg)  
  - Mass in water (g or kg)

- **Formula:**  
  \[
  \text{Density} = \frac{\text{Mass in air}}{\text{Mass in air} - \text{Mass in water}} \times \text{Density of water}
  \]
  (Density of water = 1 g/cm³ or 1000 kg/m³)
